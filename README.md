TASK DESCRIPTION-- >
Task Description: Weather Application Using MERN Stack
 **Overview**
The goal of this task is to build a weather forecasting web application using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The application will allow users to enter a city name and view the current weather conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a weather icon. The weather data will be fetched from a third-party API (like OpenWeatherMap) and presented in a clean and user-friendly interface.

**Features**
1. **Search for Weather by City**:  
   Users should be able to enter the name of a city and fetch its current weather details.

2. **Display Weather Information**:  
   Once the user inputs a city, the application will display the following weather details:
   - Temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit)
   - Weather condition (e.g., sunny, rainy, cloudy)
   - Wind speed
   - Humidity
   - Weather icon (based on the condition, fetched from the weather API)

3. **API Integration**:  
   The application should integrate with a weather API, such as OpenWeatherMap or WeatherAPI, to retrieve real-time weather data.

4. **Responsive Design**:  
   The application should be fully responsive, ensuring it works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

5. **Error Handling**:  
   If a user enters an invalid city or if the weather API fails, the application should display an appropriate error message.

6. **User-friendly UI/UX**:  
   The user interface should be simple, clean, and easy to use. The design should display all relevant weather data clearly.

7. **Location-based Weather (optional)**:  
   Optionally, you can implement geolocation features to fetch the weather data of the user's current location using the browser's Geolocation API.

8. **Weather History (optional)**:  
   Save the search history of previously searched cities in the backend, so users can see their past searches.

#### **Technology Stack**

1. **Frontend (React.js)**:
   - **React.js**: For building the user interface.
   - **Axios or Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the weather API.
   - **React Router**: For handling page routing (if applicable).
   - **CSS/Bootstrap**: For styling the application and ensuring it's responsive.

2. **Backend (Node.js + Express.js)**:
   - **Node.js**: The runtime environment for building the backend.
   - **Express.js**: A web application framework for building the server-side functionality.
   - **API calls**: Use Express to create an endpoint that fetches weather data from the third-party weather API.
   - **MongoDB (Optional)**: Store search history, user preferences, or other data (e.g., past weather searches).

3. **Weather API Integration**:
   - Use an external weather API (e.g., [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api) or [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/)) to fetch real-time weather information based on city names or geolocation.

4. **MongoDB (Optional)**:
   - If storing search history or user preferences, use MongoDB for database management. Each search can be saved as a record in MongoDB with the city name and weather data.

5. **Version Control**:
   - Use Git for version control and store your code on GitHub or any other repository hosting service.

 **Steps to Complete the Task**

1. **Set up the Backend**:
   - Initialize a Node.js project and install necessary dependencies (Express, Axios, etc.).
   - Set up the Express server and create an API endpoint that queries the weather API with the city name provided by the user.
   - Handle errors and edge cases (invalid city names, API errors).

2. **Set up the Frontend**:
   - Create a React app using `create-react-app` or your preferred method.
   - Implement the search functionality (input field for city name).
   - Display the weather data received from the backend (temperature, humidity, wind speed, weather description, and icon).

3. **Connect Backend and Frontend**:
   - Use Axios or Fetch to call the Express API endpoint from the frontend and display the data in the UI.
   - Handle loading states and error messages.

4. **Add Styling**:
   - Make sure the app is styled properly, responsive, and user-friendly.
   - Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for faster development.

5. **Optional Features**:
   - Implement geolocation-based weather data.
   - Store the search history in MongoDB.
   - Add user authentication (if required) to save user preferences.

6. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Test the application to ensure everything works as expected.
   - Debug any issues, handle edge cases, and ensure proper error handling.

7. **Deploy the Application**:
   - Once the application is ready, deploy it to platforms like Heroku, Vercel, or Netlify for the frontend and backend.

 **Deliverables**
- Source code for the frontend (React.js) and backend (Node.js + Express.js).
- A working weather application hosted on a platform (e.g., Heroku, Netlify).
- Documentation (README) outlining how to run and use the application.
- Optional: Database integration if you implemented search history functionality.

*CONCLUSION*:) 
This project will help you get hands-on experience with the MERN stack while building a practical and useful application.
